# CalmCorner-SiteLink
This is a project I have been a part of during the war, we developed a website for people to share their thoughts, reports and get medical and mental help.

I worked as a team is when I participated in a voluntary programming development project (due to the war) in which I developed a calming website for people (I worked mainly on UML diagrams for the development of the project) working with people from the industry, I learnt a lot and if you would like to check out the website the link is here - https://calm-corner.unitytechisrael.org/ .
